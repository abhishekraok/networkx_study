The main file is charnet. This calls creation of string function
alphalist,chars = sfg.createstrforgraph() 
Here alphalist is the list of characters, unordered set. chars is the input string, a sentence or read from file. All the non alphabets are removed. 

Then next step is the creation of graph using these alphalist as the nodes and adding edges based on the chars. 
After creation of graph it is analyzed and drawn.
